Solutions to CS50 problem sets, including C, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Lecture 1
*Credit*
Write a program that uses Luhn's Algorithm to determine whether a provided number is a valid credit card number and if so, what provider it belongs to.
Programming language - C

Luhn's Algorithm:
1. Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
2. Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
3. If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid.

*Mario* 
Write a program to log '#' in a pyramid of n height to the console.
Programming language - C
